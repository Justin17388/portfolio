  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Justin — a hands-on problem solver with an Applied Engineering degree in CADD
  and OSHA safety certifications. Outside of work, I am a dedicated father of three, fully
  immersed in their activities — from band competitions with the Oxford High School
  “Sound of Champions,” to helping with cheer practices, concession stands, and a full 
  lineup of dance recitals covering ballet, baton, twirl, and tap. Family means everything
  to me, and being involved is a top priority.</p>

  <p>When I’m not cheering from the sidelines or behind the concession grill, I enjoy exploring
  new technologies. I spend my free time learning code, diving into generative AI, and playing
  bass guitar and synthesizers. I also run a small 3D printing business focused on creating sensory 
  fidgets for individuals with ADHD, Autism, and other neurodivergent conditions — blending creativity
  with purpose.</p>

  <p>Professionally, I manage the website and marketing for my wife’s counseling practice, where I
  apply both creative and technical skills. Before that, I spent 12 years at a sports manufacturing
  company, where I led engineering process improvements, maintained OSHA compliance, and built powerful
  Excel tools to analyze data pulled from enterprise databases. I’m currently working toward AWS/DevOps
  certification through Clarusway and actively building my skills with additional courses on Udemy.
  My goal is to become a full-stack developer with strong cloud and automation capabilities.</p>

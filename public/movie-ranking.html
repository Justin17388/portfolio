<h1>The Best Movies According to Justin</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>JAWS</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie of all time. The way the atmosphere
    and score are used to overcome the special effects capabilities
    of the time is absolutley masterful.</p>

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>My grandfather was a WWII veteran and he used to tell me stories
   of what he went through. This movie does an amazing job capturing 
   that storytelling spirit.</p>

<h3>Die Hard</h3>
<p>Because you know it is not officially Christmas until Hans Gruber
   falls off Nakatomi Plaza Tower. I'm just saying.
